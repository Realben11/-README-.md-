## Product Analysis

Perform an analysis on the data to understand the various product lines, identify which product lines are performing best, and determine which ones need improvement.

## Sales Analysis

Analyze the sales data to identify trends and measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy. Use the results to determine what modifications are needed to increase sales.

## Customer Analysis

Conduct an analysis to uncover different customer segments, their purchase trends, and the profitability of each segment.

## Feature Engineering

- **Time of Day**: Add a new column named `time_of_day` to categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This will provide insights into which part of the day generates the most sales.
- **Day of the Week**: Add a new column named `day_name` to record the day of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) for each transaction. This will help determine which day of the week each branch is busiest.
- **Month of the Year**: Add a new column named `month_name` to indicate the month (Jan, Feb, Mar) of each transaction. This will help identify which month has the highest sales and profit.

## Revenue And Profit Calculations
 COGS = unit_price * quantity.
VAT = 5% * COGS.
total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS.
grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS.
Gross Margin = (gross income / total revenue)  .
Unit Price = 45.79.
Quantity = 7.
COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53.
VAT = 5% * COGS = 5% * 320.53 = 16.0265.
Total = VAT + COGS = 16.0265 + 320.53 = 336.5565.
Gross Margin Percentage = (gross income / total revenue) * 100 â‰ˆ 4.76% .
